The hardest thing is to go to sleep at night, when there are so many urgent things needing to be done. A huge gap exists between what we know is possible with today's machines and what we have so far been able to finish. The most important thing in the programming language is the name. A language will not succeed without a good name. I have recently invented a very good name and now I am looking for a suitable language. There's ways to amuse yourself while doing things and thats how I look at efficency. Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.
